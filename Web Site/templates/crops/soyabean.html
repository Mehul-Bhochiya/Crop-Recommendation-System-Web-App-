                <h3>Information about Soybean</h3>
                <p>Soybean is a protein-rich legume crop used for food, oil extraction, and animal feed. It thrives in warm temperatures with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil. The crop undergoes vegetative and reproductive stages before reaching maturity, producing pods filled with soybeans. Soybeans are essential for oil production and are widely used in food products like tofu, soy milk, and animal feed.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Soybean is harvested when the pods turn brown and the seeds inside are firm, with a moisture content of around 13-15%. Mechanical harvesters are commonly used to cut and thresh the pods efficiently. Manual harvesting is done in small farms by uprooting plants and threshing them later. Post-harvest, soybeans should be dried to reduce moisture below 12% for safe storage and processing.</p>
