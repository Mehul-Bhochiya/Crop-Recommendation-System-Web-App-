                <h3>Information about Jute</h3>
                <p>Jute is a fiber crop grown for making ropes, bags, mats, and textiles. It requires warm temperatures, high humidity, and well-drained loamy soil with adequate water supply. Jute plants grow tall and develop strong fibers in their stems. The fibers are extracted through a process called retting.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Jute is harvested when the plants reach 8-10 feet in height and before they start flowering. The stalks are cut close to the ground and bundled together for retting in water for 10-15 days. After retting, fibers are manually separated from the stalks and dried before processing. Proper drying and storage in dry conditions maintain fiber quality for commercial use.
