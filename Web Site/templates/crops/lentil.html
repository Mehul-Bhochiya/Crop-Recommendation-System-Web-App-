            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Lentils are harvested when the pods turn brown, and the seeds inside are firm. Manual harvesting involves cutting the plants and drying them before threshing. Mechanical harvesters are used in large-scale farming to speed up the process. Proper drying is essential to reduce moisture content below 12% for safe storage. Storing lentils in airtight containers helps prevent insect infestations.</p>
