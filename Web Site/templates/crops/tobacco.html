                <h3>Information about Tobacco</h3>
                <p>Tobacco is a commercial crop primarily grown for its leaves, which are used in cigarette production and other tobacco products. It thrives in warm temperatures with well-drained sandy loam soil. Tobacco plants produce broad leaves that are harvested and cured for processing.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Tobacco leaves are harvested when they mature and develop the required texture and color. Manual harvesting is done by plucking leaves at different stages, while large farms use mechanical harvesters. After harvesting, the leaves undergo curing (air, flue, or sun curing) to develop their distinct flavor. Proper storage in dry conditions prevents mold and quality degradation.</p>
