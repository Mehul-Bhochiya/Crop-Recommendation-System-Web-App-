                <h3>Information about Rice</h3>
                <p>Rice is one of the most widely consumed staple foods globally, primarily grown in regions with abundant water supply. It requires warm temperatures, high humidity, and standing water throughout most of its growth cycle. Rice is classified into different types, including upland, lowland, and deep-water rice. The crop progresses through vegetative, reproductive, and ripening stages before it is ready for harvest.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Rice is harvested when 80-90% of the grains turn golden yellow and moisture content falls to 20-25%. Manual harvesting is done using sickles, whereas large-scale farms use combine harvesters. The harvested crop undergoes threshing to separate grains from stalks, followed by drying to reduce moisture to 12-14% for safe storage. Timely harvesting prevents grain shattering and lodging. Proper post-harvest handling ensures high-quality rice for consumption and processing.</p>
