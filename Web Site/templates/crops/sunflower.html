                <h3>Information about Sunflower</h3>
                <p>Sunflower is an oilseed crop known for its high-quality edible oil. It grows well in warm temperatures with well-drained soil and requires moderate rainfall. The plant has a long taproot system, allowing it to withstand drought conditions. Sunflowers follow the sunâ€™s movement during growth, a phenomenon known as heliotropism.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Sunflower is harvested when the back of the flower heads turns brown, and the seeds inside are firm with a moisture content of about 10-12%. Manual harvesting involves cutting the heads and drying them before seed extraction, while mechanical combine harvesters are used in large farms. After harvest, seeds must be dried further to reduce moisture to 8-10% for safe storage and oil extraction.</p>
