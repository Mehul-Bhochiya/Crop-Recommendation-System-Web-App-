                <h3>Information about Wheat</h3>
                <p>Wheat is a staple cereal crop grown in temperate regions worldwide. It is rich in carbohydrates and proteins, making it a crucial food source. Wheat grows well in well-drained loamy soil with moderate rainfall and cool temperatures. It undergoes various growth stages, including tillering, heading, and grain filling, before reaching full maturity. Proper irrigation, weed control, and disease management are essential for obtaining a high yield.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Wheat is ready for harvest when the grains turn golden brown, and their moisture content falls to 12-14%. Large-scale farmers use combine harvesters, which cut, thresh, and clean the grains in one process. In small farms, manual harvesting is done using sickles, followed by threshing using mechanical threshers. Harvesting should be performed in dry weather to prevent grain spoilage. After threshing, wheat should be properly dried and stored in well-ventilated silos to avoid mold and pest infestations.</p>
