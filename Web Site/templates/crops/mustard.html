                <h3>Information about Mustard</h3>
                <p>Mustard is an oilseed crop grown for its seeds, which are used for oil extraction and spice production. It grows well in cool climates with well-drained loamy soil and moderate moisture. The mustard plant produces small yellow flowers, followed by seed pods. Mustard oil is widely used for cooking and medicinal purposes.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Mustard is harvested when the seed pods turn yellow-brown and become dry. Manual harvesting involves cutting the plants and drying them in bundles before threshing. In large-scale farming, combine harvesters are used for efficient collection. The seeds should be dried to a moisture level of 8-10% before storage to prevent fungal growth. Proper storage in airtight containers ensures long-term usability.</p>
