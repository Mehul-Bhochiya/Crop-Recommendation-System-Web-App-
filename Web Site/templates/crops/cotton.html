                <h3>Information about Cotton</h3>
                <p>Cotton is a fiber crop widely used in the textile industry. It grows well in warm climates with moderate rainfall and requires well-drained black or loamy soil. Cotton plants produce fluffy fibers around their seeds, which are used for fabric production. The crop progresses through various growth stages, including flowering and boll formation, before it is ready for harvest.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Cotton is harvested when the bolls burst open, exposing the white fibers. Manual picking is common in small farms, ensuring high-quality fibers. However, mechanical cotton pickers are used in large farms for efficiency. Harvesting should be done in dry weather to prevent fiber contamination. Post-harvest, cotton is processed through ginning to separate fibers from seeds before further refining for textile production.</p>
