                <h3>Information about Maize</h3>
                <p>Maize, also known as corn, is a versatile cereal crop used for food, animal feed, and industrial products. It thrives in warm climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. The crop undergoes various growth stages, including germination, vegetative growth, tasseling, and grain filling, before reaching maturity. Different maize varieties include sweet corn, field corn, and popcorn, each with specific uses.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Maize is harvested when kernels harden, and moisture levels drop to 20-25%. Manual harvesting involves plucking cobs from plants, while mechanical combines speed up the process for large farms. After harvesting, the cobs should be dried to reduce moisture below 14% to prevent fungal contamination. If used for fodder, the entire plant can be chopped and stored as silage. Proper storage in well-ventilated areas helps prevent pest infestations.
