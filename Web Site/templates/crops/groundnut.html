                <h3>Information about Groundnut</h3>
                <p>Groundnut, also known as peanut, is an oilseed crop grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It requires sandy loam soil and moderate rainfall for optimal growth. The plant produces underground pods containing edible seeds rich in oil and protein. Groundnuts are widely used for oil extraction, snacks, and peanut butter production.</p>

            <h3>Best Harvesting Techniques</h3>
            <p>Groundnuts are harvested when the leaves turn yellow and pods are fully developed. Manual harvesting involves uprooting the plants and shaking off excess soil, while mechanical diggers lift and invert the plants for drying. After drying, the pods are separated through threshing. Proper curing and drying reduce moisture content to around 8% for safe storage and prevent fungal contamination.</p>
